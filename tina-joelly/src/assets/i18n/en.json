    "usage-copy": "This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, email address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes all online presences (websites, online stores) that we operate, social media presences and email communication as well as mobile apps for smartphones and other devices",

    "storage-duration-copy": "It is a general criterion for us that we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes. If you wish your data to be deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible, provided there is no obligation to store it. We will inform you about the specific duration of the respective data processing below, if we have further information on this.",

    "rights-1": "In accordance with Article 15 GDPR, you have a right to information as to whether we process data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and the following information: the purpose for which we process the data, the categories, i.e. the types of data that are processed, who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed, how long the data is stored, the existence of the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing, that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below), the origin of the data if we have not collected it from you and whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically analyzed to create a personal profile of you. ",
    "rights-2": "According to Article 16 GDPR, you have a right to rectification of data, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.",
    "rights-3": "According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to erasure ('right to be forgotten'), which specifically means that you may request the erasure of your data.",
    "rights-4": "According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we may only store the data but no longer use it.",
    "rights-5": "According to Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a commonly used format upon request.",
    "rights-6": "According to Article 21 GDPR, you have the right to object, which entails a change in processing after enforcement. If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection. If data is used for direct marketing purposes, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing. If data is used for profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for profiling.",

    "data-transfer-copy-1": "We only transfer or process data to countries outside the scope of the GDPR (third countries) if you consent to this processing or other legal permission exists. This applies in particular if the processing is required by law or necessary to fulfill a contractual relationship and in any case only to the extent that this is generally permitted. In most cases, your consent is the most important reason why we process data in third countries. The processing of personal data in third countries such as the USA, where many software manufacturers offer services and have their server locations, may mean that personal data is processed and stored in unexpected ways. We expressly point out that, according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently only an adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA if a US company that processes personal data of EU citizens in the USA is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. You can find more information on this under: ",
    "data-transfer-copy-2": "Data processing by US services that are not active participants in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework may result in data not being processed and stored anonymously. Furthermore, US government authorities may be able to access individual data. In addition, data collected may be linked to data from other services of the same provider if you have a corresponding user account. Where possible, we try to use server locations within the EU, if this is offered, and we will inform you in more detail about data transfer to third countries, if applicable, in the appropriate sections of this privacy policy.",
    "security-heading": "Security of data processing",
    "security-copy": "In order to protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organizational measures. Where possible, we encrypt or pseudonymize personal data. In this way, we make it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer personal information from our data. Art. 25 GDPR refers to “data protection by design and by default”, meaning that we always think about security and take appropriate measures for both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to the server room). If necessary, we will go into more detail on specific measures below.",
    "tls-heading": "TLS encryption with https",
    "tls-copy": "TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, and they are. We use HTTPS (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure stands for “secure hypertext transfer protocol”) to transmit data tap-proof on the Internet, which means that the complete transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured - nobody can “eavesdrop”. We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and comply with data protection by design (Article 25(1) GDPR). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data.",
    "communication-heading": "Communication",

First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics).

Some cookies are deleted after less than an hour, others can remain stored on a computer for several years. You can also influence the storage period yourself. You can delete all cookies manually at any time via your browser (see also “Right to object” below). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent will be deleted at the latest after you withdraw your consent, whereby the legality of the storage remains unaffected until then.",

    "cookies-delete-copy": "You decide how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting, deactivating or only partially accepting cookies.

    "webhosting-copy-1": "If you want to view a website on a computer, tablet or smartphone, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know some web browsers by name: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari. We call them browsers or web browsers for short. To display the website, the browser must connect to another computer where the website's code is stored: the web server. Operating a web server is a complicated and time-consuming task, which is why this is usually done by professional providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure reliable and error-free storage of website data. A lot of technical terms, but please stay tuned, it gets better!",
    "webhosting-copy-2": "When the browser on your computer (desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone) connects and during data transfer to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. On the one hand, your computer stores data; on the other hand, the web server must also store data for a period of time in order to ensure proper operation.",
    "webhosting-reason-heading": "Why do we process personal data?",
    "webhosting-reason-1": "1. Professional hosting of the website and securing its operation",
    "webhosting-reason-2": "2. to maintain operational and IT security",
    "webhosting-reason-3": "3. anonymous evaluation of access behavior to improve our offer and, if necessary, for criminal prosecution or prosecution of claims",

    "webhosting-data-copy": "Even while you are currently visiting our website, our web server, i.e. the computer on which this website is stored, usually automatically saves data such as the complete Internet address (URL) of the website called up, browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87), the browser version used, and the IP address. e.g. Chrome 87), the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10), the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e.g. https://www.beispielquellsite.de/vondabinichgekommen/), the host name and IP address of the device from which access is made (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121), date and time and in files, the so-called web server log files.",
    "webhosting-storage-heading": "How long is data stored?",
    "webhosting-storage-copy": "As a rule, the above data is stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not pass this data on, but we cannot rule out the possibility of this data being viewed by authorities in the event of unlawful behavior.",
    "sm-heading": "Social Media",
    "sm-copy": "The data that is stored and processed through your use of a social media channel is primarily for the purpose of carrying out web analyses. The aim of these analyses is to be able to develop more precise and personalized marketing and advertising strategies. Depending on your behavior on a social media platform, the evaluated data can be used to draw conclusions about your interests and create user profiles. This also enables the platforms to present you with customized advertisements. Cookies are usually set in your browser for this purpose, which store data on your usage behavior. As a rule, we assume that we remain responsible under data protection law, even if we use the services of a social media platform. However, the European Court of Justice has ruled that in certain cases the operator of the social media platform may be jointly responsible with us within the meaning of Art. 26 GDPR. If this is the case, we will point this out separately and work on the basis of an agreement to this effect. The essence of the agreement is then set out below for the platform concerned. Please note that when using the social media platforms or our built-in elements, your data may also be processed outside the European Union, as many social media channels, such as Facebook or Twitter, are American companies. As a result, you may not be able to claim or enforce your rights in relation to your personal data as easily.",
    "sm-data-heading": "What data is processed?",
    "sm-data-copy": "Exactly what data is stored and processed depends on the provider of the social media platform in question. But it usually involves data such as telephone numbers, email addresses, data that you enter in a contact form, user data such as which buttons you click, who you like or follow, when you visited which pages, information about your device and your IP address. Most of this data is stored in cookies. Data can be linked to your profile, especially if you have a profile on the social media channel you are visiting and are logged in. All data that is collected via a social media platform is also stored on the provider's servers. This means that only the providers have access to the data and can provide you with the appropriate information or make changes.",
    "sm-storage-heading": "Duration of data processing",
    "sm-storage-copy": "We will inform you about the duration of data processing below if we have further information on this. For example, the social media platform Facebook stores data until it is no longer required for its own purposes. However, customer data that is compared with our own user data is deleted within two days. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. If required by law, for example in the case of accounting, this storage period may be exceeded.",
    "webdesign-heading": "Webdesign",
    "webdesign-copy": "We use various tools on our website that serve our web design. Web design is not, as is often assumed, just about making our website look pretty, but also about functionality and performance. But of course the right look of a website is also one of the major goals of professional web design. Web design is a branch of media design and deals with the visual as well as the structural and functional design of a website. The aim of web design is to improve your experience on our website. In web design jargon, this is referred to as user experience (UX) and usability. User experience refers to all impressions and experiences that website visitors have on a website. Usability is a sub-item of user experience. This is about the user-friendliness of a website. The main focus here is on ensuring that content, subpages or products are clearly structured and that you can find what you are looking for quickly and easily. In order to offer you the best possible experience on our website, we also use third-party web design tools. In this privacy policy, the category “web design” therefore includes all services that improve the design of our website. These can be, for example, fonts, various plugins or other integrated web design functions.",
    "webdesign-storage-heading": "Duration of data processing",
    "webdesign-storage-copy": "How long data is processed is very individual and depends on the web design elements used. If cookies are used, for example, the storage period can be as short as one minute or as long as a few years. Please find out more about this. We recommend that you read our general text section on cookies as well as the data protection declarations of the tools used. There you can usually find out exactly which cookies are used and what information is stored in them. Google font files, for example, are stored for one year. This is to improve the loading time of a website. In principle, data is only stored for as long as is necessary to provide the service. Data can also be stored for longer if required by law.",
    "google-fonts-heading": "Google Fonts Local Privacy Policy",
    "google-fonts-copy": "We use Google Fonts from Google Inc. on our website. Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for the European area. We have integrated the Google fonts locally, i.e. on our web server - not on Google's servers. This means that there is no connection to Google servers and therefore no data transfer or storage. Google Fonts used to also be called Google Web Fonts. This is an interactive directory with over 800 fonts that Google provides free of charge. With Google Fonts, you could use fonts without uploading them to your own server. However, in order to prevent any transfer of information to Google servers in this respect, we have downloaded the fonts to our server. In this way, we act in compliance with data protection regulations and do not send any data to Google Fonts.",
    "person-data-heading": "Personal data",
    "person-data-copy": "For the purposes of this Regulation: “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter ‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; personal data are therefore all those data that can identify you as a person. This is usually data such as name, address, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, date of birth, identification numbers such as social security number, tax identification number, ID card number or matriculation number and bank data such as account number, credit information, account balances and much more. According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), your IP address is also considered personal data. IT experts can use your IP address to determine at least the approximate location of your device and subsequently identify you as the owner of the connection. Therefore, the storage of an IP address also requires a legal basis within the meaning of the GDPR.",
